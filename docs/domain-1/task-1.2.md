## 1.2.1 Align security risk management with enterprise risk management

In the article featured in the [ISACA] Journal Volume 2, 2014 entitled **Aligning Information Security With Enterprise Risk Management Using ISO/IEC 27001:2013**, Vimal Mani, CISA, CICA povides a [three (3) page overview][ISO] of the key changes in the updated ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Standard. 

### 1.2.2 Integrate risk management throughout the lifecycle

According to The [MITRE] Corporation "all systems engineering models and processes are organized around the concept of a life cycle. Although the detailed views, implementations, and terminology used to articulate the SE life cycle differ across [MITRE]'s sponsors, they all share fundamental elements".
