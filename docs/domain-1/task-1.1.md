### 1.1 General Security Principles

### 1.1.1 Identify organizational security authority

### 1.1.2 Identify elements of a system security policy

### 1.1.3 Understand trust concepts and hierarchies

### 1.1.4 Determine boundaries governed by security policies

### 1.1.5 Specify complete mediation

### 1.1.6 Determine least common mechanism

Least common mechanism  is to minimize the amount of mechanism common to more than one user and depended on by all users.[^1] Every shared mechanism (especially one involving shared variables) represents a potential information path between users and must be designed with great care to be sure it does not unintentionally compromise security.[^2]

According to Wallach, the principle of *least common mechanism* concerns the dangers of **sharing state** among different programs, suggesting that if one program can corrupt a shared state, it can then corrupt other programs which depend on it.[^3]
 
### 1.1.7 Understand open design concepts

### 1.1.8 Analyze psychological acceptability/usability
